// NOT IN ORDER
short term: 
 - sort out render and work thread (see src/main:163)
 - implement a nicer render function with general warnings for things like printing out of bounds
 - finish erosion (see src/worldgen/mod.rs:207)
 - make worldgen module prettier, probably bring some things out of worldgen/mod.rs

 long term:
 - menu system
 - saving worlds
 - gameplay
 - history generation
